TradeExecutor
=============

* * * * *

üìÑ **Introduction**
-------------------

The `TradeExecutor` smart contract is a secure and robust system designed to manage and execute algorithmic trading bots on the Stacks blockchain. It provides a comprehensive framework for users to register trading bots, manage their capital, execute trades, and track performance. The contract is built with security, efficiency, and transparency in mind, ensuring a reliable platform for automated trading strategies.

* * * * *

‚öôÔ∏è **Functionality**
--------------------

### Bot Management

-   **Bot Registration**: Users can register a new trading bot with a unique ID, specifying its name, strategy, and maximum trade size.

-   **Bot Deactivation**: The contract owner can deactivate a bot, halting all trading activities.

-   **Bot Information Retrieval**: Anyone can query the details of a registered bot, including its owner, activity status, and performance metrics.

### Financial Operations

-   **Deposits**: Users can deposit STX tokens into their bot's dedicated balance, providing the necessary capital for trading.

-   **Trade Execution**: Bots can execute trades, with the contract automatically deducting the trade amount and a platform fee from the bot's balance.

-   **Portfolio Rebalancing**: A sophisticated function allows for the automatic rebalancing of a bot's portfolio based on predefined asset allocations, including built-in risk management features like slippage protection.

### Tracking and Analytics

-   **Balance Tracking**: Each bot's balance is meticulously tracked within the contract.

-   **Trade History**: Every trade executed is recorded in a detailed history, capturing critical data such as the trade ID, amount, type, timestamp, and profit/loss.

-   **Performance Metrics**: The contract tracks key performance indicators for each bot, including the total number of trades and cumulative profit or loss.

-   **Platform Fee Tracking**: The total fees collected by the platform are aggregated and stored.

* * * * *

üíæ **Data Structures**
----------------------

### Maps

-   `trading-bots`: Stores detailed information about each registered bot, including its owner, name, strategy, and performance statistics.

-   `user-bot-count`: Tracks the number of bots owned by each user, enforcing a `max-bots-per-user` limit.

-   `bot-balances`: Holds the STX balance for each trading bot.

-   `trade-history`: A record of all trades executed, indexed by a unique trade ID.

### Variables

-   `next-bot-id`: A counter for assigning unique IDs to new bots.

-   `next-trade-id`: A counter for assigning unique IDs to new trades.

-   `total-platform-fees`: Accumulates the total fees collected from trades.

* * * * *

üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**
----------------------

The contract uses a comprehensive set of error codes to provide clear feedback on failed transactions.

| Error Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `u100` | **err-owner-only**: The function can only be called by the contract owner. |
| `u101` | **err-not-found**: The specified bot or data entry was not found. |
| `u102` | **err-unauthorized**: The transaction sender is not authorized to perform this action. |
| `u103` | **err-invalid-amount**: The specified amount is not valid (e.g., zero or negative). |
| `u104` | **err-bot-inactive**: The target bot is currently inactive. |
| `u105` | **err-insufficient-balance**: The bot's balance is too low to cover the transaction. |
| `u106` | **err-max-bots-reached**: The user has reached the maximum limit for bot registration. |
| `u107` | **err-invalid-parameters**: The provided function parameters are invalid. |

* * * * *

üîí **Security and Auditing**
----------------------------

The contract employs several security measures, including:

-   **Transaction Sender Authorization**: Critical functions like `deactivate-bot` and `execute-trade` are restricted to the bot's owner.

-   **Input Validation**: Public functions rigorously validate all input parameters, ensuring they fall within acceptable ranges and formats.

-   **Balance Checks**: All transactions that involve funds, such as `execute-trade`, include checks to prevent overdrafts.

-   **Hardcoded Constants**: Key parameters like minimum and maximum trade amounts and the platform fee rate are defined as constants, preventing runtime manipulation.
